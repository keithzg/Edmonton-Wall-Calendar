# Edmonton-Wall-Calendar

## What and why?

Well, I read http://www.metronews.ca/news/edmonton/2016/12/23/edmontonian-makes-calendar-of-trucks-stuck-under-bridge.html and was amused until the end, where they wrote

> Many have asked if they can buy a copy, but Feisst has ?absolutely? no plans to distribute or sell the calendar ? partly because of potential copyright issues.

Pshhh. I think it's pretty clear that even if the satirical nature of this isn't enough to qualify for a defense against charges of infringement on satirical grounds, that this keeps happening would seem to make clear that this would fall under the doctrine of Fair Dealing for educational purposes alone!

Still, it's best to keep licenses and legalities clear, and there may well be room for creating an Edmonton calendar where one might want to swap out other images instead. So my intention here is to re-use some sort of [Free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) calendar template, and then a script to download appropriate images.
